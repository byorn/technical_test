Pricing Rules Flexibility
-------------------------
+ The idea is that a PricingRule can be added to the PricingRulesBO Business Object Class
  (Thinking of scalability, where PricingRule can be stored in a database)

+ Pricing Rules Logic are separated into a separate package. If business rules changes, the developer can be concerned only within the pricing rules package.
